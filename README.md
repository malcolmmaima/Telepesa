# Telepesa: Fintech Platform for African Cooperatives and MFIs

## Overview
This project is a fintech platform designed to empower African cooperatives and microfinance institutions (MFIs) by digitizing savings and loan management. It offers mobile money integration, offline capabilities, and robust security, competing with platforms like Wakandi Group. The platform aims to enhance financial inclusion with a user-friendly, scalable, and compliant solution.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**:
  - Android: Kotlin with Android Architecture Components (ViewModel, LiveData, Room)
  - iOS: Swift with SwiftUI and Core Data
- **Backend**:
  - Java Spring Boot for microservices
- **Databases**:
  - PostgreSQL for transactional data
  - MongoDB for analytics and flexible data
- **Cloud**:
  - AWS (EC2 for hosting, S3 for storage, RDS for PostgreSQL)
- **Security**:
  - AES-256 encryption
  - OAuth2 and Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **APIs**:
  - RESTful APIs for microservices and third-party integrations (e.g., M-Pesa)
- **Tools**:
  - Docker for containerization (post-MVP)
  - Git for version control

## Architecture
The platform uses a microservices architecture with an API Gateway (Spring Cloud Gateway or AWS API Gateway) for routing and authentication. Key microservices include:
- **User Service**: Manages registration, authentication, and profiles
- **Transaction Service**: Handles savings, loans, and transactions
- **Reporting Service**: Generates financial reports
- **Integration Service**: Manages mobile money and third-party integrations

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/malcolmmaima/Telepesa.git
   ```
2. **Backend Setup**:
   - Install Java 17 and Maven
   - Configure PostgreSQL and MongoDB connections in `application.properties`
   - Run each microservice: `mvn spring-boot:run`
3. **Frontend Setup**:
   - **Android**: Install Android Studio, set up Kotlin, and open the Android project
   - **iOS**: Install Xcode, set up Swift, and open the iOS project
4. **Environment Variables**:
   - Set API keys for mobile money (e.g., M-Pesa) and database credentials
5. **Dependencies**:
   - Install required libraries (e.g., Spring Boot, Room, Core Data)

## Running the Project
1. Start backend microservices:
   ```bash
   cd <microservice-directory>
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```
2. Run mobile apps:
   - Android: Build and run in Android Studio
   - iOS: Build and run in Xcode
3. Test API endpoints using tools like Postman
